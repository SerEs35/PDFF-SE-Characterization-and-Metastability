# PDFF-SE-Characterization-and-Metastability
---------------------------------------------

This project is titled "Characterizing and Comparing a D-Type Flip-Flop (DFF) with a Pre-Discharge Soft-Error Tolerant Flip-Flop (PDFF-SE)".

The project was developed in a span of 3 months, for the Engineer Project course during graduate studies.

Much of the work consists in comparing a "proposed" Flip-Flop against a "control" Flip-Flop, in terms of Soft-Error tolerance and other metrics, as a case study. The proposed device is called "Pre-Discharged Soft-Error Tolerant Flip-Flop" [1], and the control device is a typical D-type Flip Flop. 

Due to the small amount of time, the work revolved in characterizing the FF and determining the limits of operation. Further work involves simulating the device under single-event upsets (alpha particles) with a proper software, and also to look for any improvement that can be applied in the design.
